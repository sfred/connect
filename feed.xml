         <title>Target multiple agent proficiencies in a single routing step</title>
         <link>https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/doc-history.html</link>
         <description>You can target up to four different combinations of agent proficiencies per
                    routing step. By using up to three OR conditions, routing tries to match a
                    contact with four different types of agents which increases the possibility of
                    finding a suitable match. For more information, see &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/set-routing-criteria.html#set-routing-criteria-how-it-works"&gt;How routing criteria works&lt;/a&gt;. </description>

         <description>You can create conditionally required fields to streamline case field
                    population for agents and reduce data entry errors. You can configure case
                    templates that prompt agents to enter relevant information in specific
                    situations. For more information, see &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/case-field-conditions.html"&gt;Add case field

         <title>Use Agent Workspace audio optimization for Citrix and Amazon WorkSpaces virtual
                    desktops</title>
         <link>https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/doc-history.html</link>
         <description>You can use Amazon Connect Agent Workspace to redirect audio from Citrix and Amazon WorkSpaces
                    Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) environments to an agent's local device.
                    Audio redirection improves voice quality and reduces latency for voice calls
                    handled on virtual desktops. It provides a better experience for both end
                    customers and agents. For more information, see &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/optimize-audio-cdd.html"&gt;Use Agent Workspace

         <description>You can set up variations to standard day-of-the-week operating hours in
                    advance. You can configure overrides by using the Amazon Connect admin website or APIs. During daily
                    contact handling, Amazon Connect automatically checks for overrides and provides your
                    customers with an appropriate flow path, such as offering a callback when the
                    call center is closed. After an override period passes, your call center
                    automatically reverts to standard hours of operation. For more information, see
                        &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/set-hours-operation.html#set-holiday-hours"&gt;Set overrides for extended, reduced, and holiday hours&lt;/a&gt;. For a list

         <description>You can track the originating agent when they create a task manually from the
                    agent workspace or Contact Control Panel (CCP). This capability allows
                    supervisors to run analytics on how many tasks are created by an individual
                    agent. For more information, see &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/tasks.html#createdby-tasks.html"&gt;Track who

         <link>https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/doc-history.html</link>
         <description>You can enable customers to request callbacks from chats, tasks, and email, in
                    addition to voice calls. For example, if a customer reaches out after hours when
                    no agent is available, they can request a callback by sending a chat message or
                    completing a webform request that uses tasks. Callbacks allow your customers to
                    get a call from an available agent during normal business hours, without
                    requiring them to stay on the line. For more information, see &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/setup-queued-cb.html"&gt;Set up queued callbacks&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

         <description>You can set task durations to expire up to 30 days from creation, with a
                    default of 7 days. For example, you can specify one issue to expire at 2 hours
                    from creation for urgent escalations, and specify another issue for mandatory
                    training to stay active for 30 days. For more information, see &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/task-templates.html"&gt;Create task templates&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

         <description>During a video call or screen sharing session, agents are able to see the
                    customer's video or screen share even when the customer is on hold. It is the
                    customer's responsibility to handle personally identifiable information (PII)
                    accordingly. If you want to change this behavior, you can build a custom Contact
                    Control Panel (CCP) and communication widget. For more information, see &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/inapp-calling.html"&gt;Set

         <title>Automated rotation of agent shifts</title>
         <link>https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/doc-history.html</link>
         <description>You can create a pattern of shifts that agents will repeatedly rotate through
                    (for example, morning shift, afternoon shift, night shift). You can define how
                    many weeks each shift should be scheduled before moving to the next one in the
                    rotation. This feature makes it easier to administrate schedules and ensure that
                    agents receive a business-defined sequence of shifts. For more information, see
                        &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/shift-rotations.html"&gt;Set up shift rotation

         <title>Updates to Routing Profiles and Queues Search APIs</title>
         <link>https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/doc-history.html</link>
         <description>You can search for routing profiles by associated queues, and search for
                    queues based on the routing profile they are assigned to by using the
                        &lt;code class="code"&gt;SearchRoutingProfile&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class="code"&gt;SearchQueues&lt;/code&gt; APIs. These
                    search APIs allow you to query by both name and ID, and support granular access
                    controls (using tags) over the associated resources. For more information, see

         <description>You can now offer a contact in a queue to a specific agent or set of agents
                    based on user ID; if the agent is not available within a given period of time,
                    you can expire off the routing criteria to instead offer the contact to any
                    available agent in queue. For more information, see &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/proficiency-routing.html"&gt;Routing using agent

         <description>Amazon Q in Connect, a generative-AI powered assistant for contact center agents,
                    recommends step-by-step guides in real-time. Agents use step-by-step guides to
                    quickly take action to resolve customer issues. For more information, see &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/integrate-q-with-guides.html"&gt;Integrate
                        Amazon Q in Connect with step-by-step guides&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, see the following

         <title>Updated AmazonConnectReadOnlyAccess managed policy</title>
         <link>https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/doc-history.html</link>
         <description>Updated the managed policy due to the renaming of the Amazon Connect action
                        &lt;code class="code"&gt;connect:GetFederationTokens&lt;/code&gt; to
                        &lt;code class="code"&gt;connect:AdminGetEmergencyAccessToken&lt;/code&gt;. This change is backwards
                    compatible and the use of either action name will continue to work in your
                    policies. For more information, see &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/security_iam_awsmanpol.html#security-iam-awsmanpol-updates"&gt;Amazon Connect updates to AWS managed policies&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

         <description>You can generate, view, and download forecasts in the time zone where your
                    business operates. Amazon Connect automatically adjusts forecasts to account for daylight
                    saving changes. For example, if your contact center receives contacts from
                    8AM-8PM US Eastern time, then forecasts will automatically switch from 8AM-8PM
                    Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) to 8AM-8PM Eastern Standard Time (EST) on November
                    3, 2024. Time zone support in forecasts simplifies the day-to-day experience for
                    managers. For more information, see &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/set-forecast-timezone.html"&gt;Set the forecast

         <description>You can pause and resume all tasks that aren't expired, disconnected, or

                    example, because of a missing approval or waiting on an external input. For more

         <link>https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/doc-history.html</link>
         <description>Amazon Connect outbound campaigns supports high-volume voice outreach by
                    using the &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_BatchPutContact.html"&gt;BatchPutContact&lt;/a&gt; API. You can use your own list management
                    capability to set up the contact strategy (for example, campaign start and end
                    times, do-not-call times, maximum contact attempts), while programmatically
                    using the Amazon Connect predictive dialer with machine learning (ML)–powered answering
                    machine detection. This increases live-party connections and reduces the amount
                    of time agents waste with unanswered calls. You can also track outcomes of all
                    campaign calls using the Amazon Connect contact record. </description>

         <title>Add as many as four access control tags to a single security profile</title>
         <link>https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/doc-history.html</link>
         <description>Adding additional access control tags will make a given security profile more
                    restrictive. For example, if you add four access control tags like
                        &lt;code class="code"&gt;BPO:AcmeCorp&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class="code"&gt;Specialty:Claims&lt;/code&gt;,
                        &lt;code class="code"&gt;Department:Billing&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code class="code"&gt;City:NewYork&lt;/code&gt;, the user
                    would only be able to see resources containing all four of these tags. For more
                    information, see &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/tag-based-access-control.html#tag-based-access-control-config-limitations"&gt; Tag-based access control configuration limitations&lt;/a&gt;.</description>

         <description>You can create rules that automatically send emails or tasks to managers based
                    on the values of real-time metrics. This enables you to alert managers on

         <title>"Maximum contacts in queue" includes all channels</title>
         <link>https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/doc-history.html</link>
         <description>If you have a queue that combines more than one channel, and you set a custom
                    value for &lt;b&gt;Maximum contacts in queue&lt;/b&gt;, the queue stops
                    accepting new contacts after that number is reached, regardless of the
                    distribution of contacts. For example, if you set the value to 50, and the first
                    50 contacts are chats, then voice calls are not routed to this queue. For more
                    information, see &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/set-maximum-queue-limit.html"&gt;Set the Maximum

         <description>You can apply granular permissions to the agent activity audit report in the
                    Amazon Connect historical metrics UI using resource tagging and tag-based access
                    controls.

         <link>https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/doc-history.html</link>
         <description>You can now update up to 100 user records on the Amazon Connect admin website in less than half the
                    time it used to take to make bulk updates. This enhancement is especially useful
                    during contact surges when you may need to change the routing profile for many
                    agents. For more information, see &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/edit-users-in-bulk.html"&gt;Edit users in

         <description>Released a new type of attributes called a flow attribute. Flow attributes are
                    restricted to the flow in which they are configured. They are useful in
                    situations where you don't want to persist the data throughout the contact, such
                    as when you need to use sensitive information like the customer's credit card
                    number to do a Lambda data dip. For more information, see &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/connect-attrib-list.html#flow-attributes"&gt;Flow attributes&lt;/a&gt;. </description>

         <description>To help you distinguish blocks in a flow, you can customize the names of
                    blocks. For example, you might rename a &lt;em&gt;Play Prompt&lt;/em&gt; flow
                    block to &lt;em&gt;Welcome message&lt;/em&gt; or a &lt;em&gt;Get customer
                        input&lt;/em&gt; flow block to &lt;em&gt;Hotel booking Lex bot&lt;/em&gt;.

         <title>Archive, restore, and delete flows and modules</title>
         <link>https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/doc-history.html</link>
         <description>You can archive, restore, and delete flows and modules by using the Amazon Connect
                    admin website. This makes it easier to manage flows and modules that are not in
                    use or no longer needed. For example, flows used only during certain times of
                    the year can be archived when not in use and then unarchived when needed. When a
                    flow has been archived, you can then permanently delete the flow so it is no
                    longer available within your list of flows. For more information, see &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/delete-contact-flow"&gt;Archive, restore, and delete flows and modules&lt;/a&gt;. </description>

         <title>Schedule flexible days and shift activities based on shift length</title>
         <link>https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/doc-history.html</link>
         <description>You can generate agent schedules that have the appropriate number of
                    activities, such as breaks or meals, depending on the duration of the shift. The
                    required number of breaks and meals are automatically placed in schedules that
                    are compliant to various regional labor laws. You can generate agent schedules
                    that include flexible days, that is, days that will be optionally scheduled if
                    there's a need. Amazon Connect can automatically generate flexible schedules that are
                    compliant to agent's contracts and regional labor laws, thereby saving time for
                    schedulers. For more information, see &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/scheduling-create-shift-profiles.html"&gt;Create

                    allowance for time off by hour, for each calendar day, for specific time off
                    activities. Amazon Connect uses the time off balance to automatically approve or decline
                    time off requests based on the agent's available net balance and the group
                    allowance for time off. For more information, see &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/upload-timeoff-balance.html"&gt;Import an

         <description>Amazon Connect Customer Profiles supports rule-based resolution to match and merge similar profiles
                    into unified ones. This enables you to enhance customer service by granting
                    agents and automated systems access to relevant customer information. As a

         <description>Case assignment helps organizations reduce the time to resolve customer issues
                    by clearly tracking case activities and resolution ownership. Agents can
                    associate a case with a queue or an individual agent for resolution. Agents can
                    view and filter cases assigned to their queue, and managers can directly assign
                    cases to individual agents. For more information, see &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/case-assignment.html"&gt;Set up case assignment&lt;/a&gt;. </description>

         <description>The &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_GetMetricDataV2.html"&gt;GetMetricDataV2&lt;/a&gt; API is available in the AWS GovCloud (US-West)
                    Region. GetMetricDataV2 is now available in all AWS Regions where Amazon Connect is offered. This API enables you to access the trailing 35 days
                    of historical agent and contact metrics (for example, service level, average
                    handle time) with customizable filters and groupings. You can use
                    GetMetricDataV2 to build custom dashboards to measure queue and agent
                    performance over time. For example, you can identify the number of contacts that
                    were disconnected by an agent versus disconnected by a customer hanging up. For

         <description>You can configure an agent’s routing profile to receive contacts from multiple
                    channels at the same time. For example, while an agent is on a voice contact,
                    they can be offered contacts from any other channels enabled in the routing
                    profile, such as chats and tasks. For more information, see &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/routing-profiles.html"&gt;Create a routing profile&lt;/a&gt;.

         <title>Added staff level shift profile</title>
         <link>https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/doc-history.html</link>
         <description>You can assign a shift profile to individual agents. This is useful to do
                    when, for example, you have part-time agents who are in the same staffing group
                    as your full-time agents, but they require their own shift profile. For more
                    information, see the &lt;b&gt;Associate to shift profile&lt;/b&gt; option

         <description>Inside the out-of-the-box Amazon Connect agent workspace, you can create
                    workflows that walk agents through custom UI pages that suggest what to do at a
                    given moment during a customer interaction. You can create guides that help
                    agents identify customer issues and recommend subsequent actions, as well as
                    surface screen-pops and forms for submitting transactions and disposition codes.

         <title>Configure multiple IAM roles that can be assigned to a single user when using

         <link>https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/doc-history.html</link>
         <description> You can configure multiple IAM roles that can be assigned to a single user
                    when using SAML 2.0 which enables you to support user access from multiple
                    identity providers simultaneously. For example, if you are migrating identity
                    providers, you can configure multiple IAM roles associated to a single user and
                    that user will be able to access Amazon Connect from either provider. To learn more about
                    configuring IAM roles for SAML 2.0 in Amazon Connect, see the &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/configure-saml.html"&gt;Configure SAML with IAM

         <description>Customers often start a chat, then leave the conversation and return later to
                    continue chatting. This may happen many times over the course of several days,
                    months, or even years. To support long running chats like these, you enable
                    persistent chat. For more information, see &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/chat-persistence.html"&gt;Enable persistent

         <description>When a chat conversation between an agent and a customer has been inactive (no
                    messages sent) for a certain amount of time, you may want to consider a chat
                    participant to be idle, and you may even want to automatically disconnect an
                    agent from the chat. To set up chat timeout timers, see &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/setup-chat-timeouts.html"&gt;Set up chat

                    metadata to a third party bot. For more information, see &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/API_StartChatContact.html"&gt;StartChatContact&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Amazon Connect API Reference

         <link>https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/doc-history.html</link>

         <title>New API to change agent's current status</title>
         <link>https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/doc-history.html</link>
         <description>Amazon Connect provides an API to programmatically change the current status of an
                    agent. &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/metrics-agent-status.html"&gt;Agent
                        statuses&lt;/a&gt; are used to determine when an agent is
                        &lt;b&gt;Available&lt;/b&gt; to be routed contacts in Amazon Connect, versus when
                    they are set to &lt;b&gt;Offline&lt;/b&gt; or a custom status such as
                        &lt;b&gt;Lunch&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;Break&lt;/b&gt; and should not be

         <title>Announced upcoming fixes for chat metrics</title>
         <link>https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/doc-history.html</link>
         <description>Currently Amazon Connect incorrectly reports that chat contacts that were created from
                    disconnect flows were created from transfer flows. When the fixes are released,
                    Amazon Connect will correctly reflect in the contact records and agent event stream that
                    these chat contacts were created from disconnect flows. For more information,

         <link>https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/doc-history.html</link>
         <description>You can use the Amazon Connect Flow language to efficiently update flows that you're
                    migrating from one instance to another, and Write flows rather than drag blocks
                    onto the flow designer. For more information, see &lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/APIReference/flow-language.html"&gt;Amazon Connect Flow
                        language&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Amazon Connect API Reference
